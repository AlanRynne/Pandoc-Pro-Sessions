               introduces the differential geometry of curves and surfaces in
               both local and global aspects. The presentation departs from the
               traditional approach with its more extensive use of elementary
               linear algebra and its emphasis on basic geometrical facts
               rather than machinery or random details. Many examples and
               exercises enhance the clear, well-written exposition, along with
               hints and answers to some of the problems. The treatment begins
               with a chapter on curves, followed by explorations of regular
               surfaces, the geometry of the Gauss map, the intrinsic geometry
               of surfaces, and global differential geometry. Suitable for
               advanced undergraduates and graduate students of mathematics,
               this text's prerequisites include an undergraduate course in
               linear algebra and some familiarity with the calculus of several
               variables. For this second edition, the author has corrected,

  title = {Geodesic Lines on Free-Form Surfaces - Optimized Grids for Timber Rib Shells},
  author = {Weinand, Yves and Pirazzi, Claudio},
  journal = {World Conference in Timber Engineering WCTE},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {In addition to glue-laminated timber, screw-laminated   timber has increasingly been applied to rib shells. The   ribs are made from laminated timber boards, which are   joined together with the aid of pin-like fasteners such as   screws or nails. The current research is meant to optimize   these grids on free-form surfaces with regard to the   bending stress due to initial curvature of the boards.   This can be done by arranging the ribs according to   geodesic lines which allows the application of straight   boards, subjected only to bending about their week axis   and to torsion. The determination of such geodesic grids   on free-form surfaces, currently enjoying great popularity   in contemporary architecture, is quite complex. In order   to satisfy this demand and to improve automation of the   production process, the software GEOS has been developed   in close collaboration with the Laboratory of Timber   Construction (EPFL/IBOIS) and the chair of Geometry   (EPFL/GEOM). This software calculates grids of geodesic   lines on free-form surfaces and provides all geometrical   data necessary for computer-controlled sawing. Free-form   surfaces are treated as Bézier surfaces. In order to   proved the reliability of the assumptions the program is   based upon, a timber rib shell prototype   (length/width/height: 8000 mm x 3000 mm x 2060 mm) was   build. Thin timber laths (12/60 mm) were used. All laths   were sawn and predrilled by means of computer-controlled   sawing. The prototype could thus be built in relatively   short time. In general, it can be stated that even after   assembly of the fourth layer the predrilled holes at the   intersections fitted precisely about 85% of the time. This   confirms the reliability of the calculation and shows that   the demanded precision is kept even for significant   curvatures. For a better understanding of the load-bearing   behavior of the structure load tests were carried out. The   comparison of the measured deformations with the   calculated deformations enabled us to evaluate the   calculation model, based on a framed load-bearing system.   For small charges, good accordance between calculation and   reality could be noticed. The software GEOS provides an   important tool for the design and the realization of   timber rib shells. It contributes to clarifying current   uncertainties in the design planning process and will   highly improve the confidence of engineers and architects   in conceiving and realizing this type of challenging   lightweight spatial structures.},

abstract = {Abstract Rationalization and construction-aware design dominate the issue of realizability of freeform architecture. The former means the decomposition of an intended shape into parts which are sufficiently simple and efficient to manufacture; the latter refers to a design procedure which already incorporates rationalization. Recent contributions to this topic have been concerned mostly with small-scale parts, for instance with planar faces of meshes. The present paper deals with another important aspect, namely long-range parts and supporting structures. It turns out that from the pure geometry viewpoint this means studying families of curves which cover surfaces in certain well-defined ways. Depending on the application one has in mind, different combinatorial arrangements of curves are required. We here restrict ourselves to so-called hexagonal webs which correspond to a triangular or tri-hex decomposition of a surface. The individual curve may have certain special properties, like being planar, being a geodesic, or being part of a circle. Each of these properties is motivated by manufacturability considerations and imposes constraints on the shape of the surface. We investigate the available degrees of freedom, show numerical methods of optimization, and demonstrate the effectivity of our approach and the variability of construction solutions derived from webs by means of actual architectural designs.?}
